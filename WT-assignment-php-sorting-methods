There are 6 sorting functions for arrays in PHP.

1. sort():
This function sorts arrays in ascending order of their alphabetical letter/ numerical order.We will use this method when we need to sort arrays in ascending alphabetical order / numerical order
CODE::

<?php
$names = ["Ram","Hari","Sita"];
sort($names);  //sorting function called

$len = count($names);
for($i = 0; $i < $names ;$i++){
	echo $names[$i];
    echo "<br>";

}
?>

This will sort the given array items and print out following output:: 

Hari
Ram
Sita


2. rsort():
This function does reverse of what sort() did i.e. this function will sort arrays in descending order of their alphabetical letter or numerical order.
CODE::

<?php
$names = ["Ram","Hari","Sita"];
rsort($names);  //sorting function called

$len = count($names);
for($i = 0; $i < $names ;$i++){
	echo $names[$i];
    echo "<br>";

}
?>

This will sort the given array items and print out following output:: 

Sita
Ram
Hari

forEach($names as $name => $age){
	echo "Name = ".$name. " age = " .$age;
